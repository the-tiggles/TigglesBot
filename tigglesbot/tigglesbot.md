# TigglesBot

## Getting Started

Here's some important links: 

1. [DiscordJs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) Docs
2. [Node School](https://nodeschool.io/) 

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
